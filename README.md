# mergeMe
Welcoming to Merge Me, an open source repository that allows you to practice making your first pull/merge requests.

As a new programmer, the thought of performing your first git request can be a little scary. But it's time to put all your fears aside, pull yourself up, and git with the program. *See what I did there?*
