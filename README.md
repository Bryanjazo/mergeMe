# Merge Me
Welcoming to Merge Me, an open source repository that allows you to practice making your first pull/merge requests.

As a new programmer, the thought of performing your contribution can be a little scary. But it's time to put all your fears aside, pull yourself up, and git with the program. *See what I did there?*

## Getting Started

If you open up index.html in the browser, you'll find a small application with a few features:

    * Directions for creating your first pull/merge request
    * A section for you to practice making git requests

After reading the directions, go ahead and try out making your first pull request. After you've competed everything correctly and pushed up your contribution, we'll approve it, and you'll be able see it on the main branch. That's all there is to successfully created your first contribution on github!
